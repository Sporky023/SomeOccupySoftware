This file takes the place of a ticket or project tracking system like Pivotal Tracker.

As the project grows, and especially if others become involved, this should be phased out and a proper project management system brought in.

The purpose of this file is to track what my plan is as the commits pile up.

[x] populate database with some seed data

[-] get a tagging workflow in place:
  [x] user is viewing a document's body text
  [-] user highlights text within the body
  [-] upon mouseup, a form appears to the side so you can tag the chunk of text you highlighted
    - the action is chunks/create
    [x] "this is the text you highlighted" (for confirmation)
    [x] hidden: document_id
    [x] hidden: starting_character
    [x] hidden: ending_character
    [-] text field: comma separated tags
    [-] submit: "save tags"
  [x] user types in some tags:  "peanut butter, jelly"
  [x] user clicks "save tags"
  [ ] then on the tags screen
    [ ] should see "peanut butter", "jelly"
  [ ] click "peanut butter"
  [ ] then see "the text you highlighted"
    [ ] with a link to the document
    
  (I realize this reads a lot like cucumber - I currently don't know how to handle simulating a highlight-this-text workflow in cucumber)
