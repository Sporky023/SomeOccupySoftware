This file takes the place of a ticket or project tracking system like Pivotal Tracker.

As the project grows, and especially if others become involved, this should be phased out and a proper project management system brought in.

The purpose of this file is to track what my plan is as the commits pile up.

[ ] populate database with some seed data

[ ] get a tagging workflow in place:
  [ ] user is viewing a document's body text
  [ ] user highlights text within the body
  [ ] upon mouseup, a form appears to the side so you can tag the chunk of text you highlighted
    - the action is chunks/create
    [ ] "this is the text you highlighted" (for confirmation)
    [ ] text field: comma separated tags
    [ ] hidden: document_id
    [ ] hidden: starting_character
    [ ] hidden: ending_character
    [ ] submit: "save tags"
