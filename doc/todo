[x] add users, login, remember me, etc
  
[ ] documents belong to users
[ ] chunks belong to users  (and hence taggings)

[ ] documents have states: draft, published

[ ] when viewing a document, should be able to see the set of tags
  [ ] also see which chunks of text have been tagged
    [ ] maybe when hovering over a tag, see that chunk scroll into view and get highlighted

[no] do we really need a link to "chunks"?

[ ] ensure emails are going out

[ ] paginate documents




--------------------------------------------------
this was the first basic functionality


This file takes the place of a ticket or project tracking system like Pivotal Tracker.

As the project grows, and especially if others become involved, this should be phased out and a proper project management system brought in.

The purpose of this file is to track what my plan is as the commits pile up.

[x] populate database with some seed data

[-] get a tagging workflow in place:
  [x] user is viewing a document's body text
  [x] user highlights text within the body
  [x] upon mouseup, a form appears to the side so you can tag the chunk of text you highlighted
    - the action is chunks/create
    [x] "this is the text you highlighted" (for confirmation)
    [x] hidden: document_id
    [x] hidden: starting_character
    [x] hidden: ending_character
    [x] text field: comma separated tags
    [x] submit: "save tags"
  [x] user types in some tags:  "peanut butter, jelly"
  [x] user clicks "save tags"

[x] browse tags
  [x] on the tags screen
    [x] should see "peanut butter", "jelly"
  [x] click "peanut butter"
  [x] then see "the text you highlighted"
    [x] with a link to the document
    
  (I realize this reads a lot like cucumber - I currently don't know how to handle simulating a highlight-this-text workflow in cucumber)
